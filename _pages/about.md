<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. student at the School of Computer Science and Technology, Tongji University, supervised by Prof. Liang Hu (**Head of the Collaborative and Intelligent Computing Laboratory**). My main research interests include **Continual Learning, Machine Unlearning, Brain-inspired AI, and Model Memory Mechanisms**, with a focus on exploring and developing innovative methods to enable machine learning models to learn, forget, and manage their own memory in a manner similar to the human brain.

I hold a Master’s degree in Science, majoring in Mathematics, under the supervision of **Prof. Feilong Cao** at Chian Jiliang University (also thanks to **Prof. Hailing Ye** at Chian Jiliang University and **Prof. Ming Li** at Zhejiang Normal University). My academic background combines strong theoretical foundations with practical skills, enabling interdisciplinary research.

I am open to collaborations with researchers and teams sharing interests in **Lifelong Learning**, aiming to explore novel research directions, exchange ideas, and advance the application of related technologies in practice.
